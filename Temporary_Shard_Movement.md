* Copy the initial Shard folder to the other directory

* Index data to solr cloud collection

* Stop solr

* move the new Shard folder to the other directory

* create the simp link for the initial folder in the /solr-8.11.2/example/cloud/node2/solr/ with the same name.

        ln -s /solr_node_bkp/Shard_test_shard1_replica_n1/ Shard_test_shard1_replica_n1

* restart solr 

* check for the shards

* now stop solr 

* create the simp link for the new shard folder in the /solr-8.11.2/example/cloud/node2/solr/ with the same name.

* start solr again and check for the shards

* when i try to create the replica of the directory and start solr
 
* This may be because whenever we make changes in the data in the shard. its updated in segment_% file inside the Shard_test_shard1_replica_n1/data/index directory. It have data like
 
      ?ï¿½lsegments
      ï¿½'[ï¿½wï¿½Kï¿½*ï¿½ï¿½k2_0ï¿½'[ï¿½wï¿½Kï¿½*ï¿½ï¿½gLucene87ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½'[ï¿½wï¿½Kï¿½*ï¿½ï¿½jcommitTimeMSec
      1722428280559commitCommandVer1806096956715433984ï¿½(ï¿½ï¿½>Qï¿½
* i think its the problem because of commitTimeMSec and commitCommandVer in this file.
 
* also whenever we update or insert data the segment_% file becoming like segment_2 -> segment_3 -> segment_4 .....
 
* for example : the above code is segment_2, Now i added data to collection then then segment_3 came like
